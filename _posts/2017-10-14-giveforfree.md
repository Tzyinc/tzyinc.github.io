title: "Give For Free"

Give For Free was a project thought up by a good friend of mine. The idea was simple: Snap pictures of your preloved goods on Give For Free, choose your favourite charity and how much you think your items are worth. When another user wants your item, they will donate to your charity at your listed price. We managed to onboard SPCA and had over 500 users within two weeks of launch.

The actual site was taken down due to server costs, and we managed to raise almost 400 dollars for SPCA. [Facebook promotional page here](https://www.facebook.com/give4free/)
