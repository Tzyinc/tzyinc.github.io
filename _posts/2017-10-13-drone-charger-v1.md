Another quick but more useful project, I used what I learnt from the bench top power supply to make this USB power-cutter (for lack of a better name). I needed a Device to turn off power after charging my Hubsan X4 for exactly 1 hour, as over charging the batteries was highly discouraged. I got a cheap Arduino micro clone I had lying around and attached it to a couple of female jumper wires. This was then connected to a relay. The timer is hardcoded into the Arduino. Maybe one day I will upgrade it with an LCD and some buttons, maybe use a one channel relay since that is all I need and put it in a proper enclosure. In the meantime, this will do!
