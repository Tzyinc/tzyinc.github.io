I have made it a point to write some of my ideas down on telegram, I will need to find a sustainable solution to update this list as and when I write more stuff in it, for now I'll just write the ideas down here

- "who wrote this project" git crawler
- graph ui (basically the graphql of ui. write garph query in templating engine, generate ui?)
- slide controller using posenet
- shadow boxing guide
- Text to picture
- Electric ukulele visualisation
- Speech to text but with tone (represented with emoji?)
