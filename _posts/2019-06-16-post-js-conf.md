title: "Post js conf"

I'm writing this about 2 weeks after I've attended jsconf, so my memory will be hazy about everything. Here's a few actionable things I want to do after what I've learnt at jsconf:

- Blog more.
  - This is really not too related to jsconf, but I did read [this brilliant post by swyx](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/) and it's crazy inspiring. I'm not him and it's unlikely I will be as active and as motivated as him, but I think this is a good way to be some inbetween, I may not be the second swyx or the second gaow, but at least I can be the first tenzy
- Play more with Tensorflow.js (and maybe git gud at AI once and for all)
  - [Charlie Gerard](https://twitter.com/devdevcharlie) made some really cool demos on stage, and after using the tensorflow.js in the hackathon (more on that next post) I realised that AI tools are so accessible now, I really should be doing more.
- Participate more in twitter
  - particularly, write TILs for what I've learnt. Initally I wanted to do something every day, but I'm not really keeping up with it, so I will have to fine tune the frequency
- Use more diverse frameworks
  - The talk from [Evan You](https://twitter.com/youyuxi) made me rethink about framework loyalty. Every framework solving a different problem is such an obvious conclusion but the fact that I never reached there on my own makes me feel that I actually have some software engineering maturing to do
- Join community events more frequently
  - It was after all the super silly hackathon that introduced me to this event and also the free tickets. Not to mention my dvd logo being plastered all over the event. I feel that there's only good to be had from being in the community events, and in the worst case, maybe I'll help someone
