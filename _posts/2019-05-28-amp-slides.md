Having "volunteered" to give a talk about my experience in japan, I decided to make my slides out of AMP itself. By using handlebars templating engine, I wrote [a tool that converted json into slides](https://github.com/Tzyinc/amp-playground) if i were to continue this project, I think I would write it in some proper framework and not use the completely uneccessary templating engine.

[See the slides](https://tzyinc.github.io/AMPslides.html)
