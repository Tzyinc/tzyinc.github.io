title: "IoT Scale (From Old Portfolio)"

This is a project for my internship at Boon Software for Breadtalk. Powered by an Arduino clone(again), this device uses and ESP8266 which communicates to the Arduino via Serial i/o. I wrote my own TCP Sender and Receiver on both the Arduino side as well as the Java side. There are many things that could be improved, but this is the first version.

The idea of this Weighing scale is that whenever the number of bread (teabags are used in the video) falls below a certain threshold, the bakers will get a message in their kitchen that they need to bake more. This is especially useful for promotional items, such as the currently running salted egg yolk croissant where the manager is unable to use previous sales value (because it is a one-off item) to estimate how much bread each outlet needs.
