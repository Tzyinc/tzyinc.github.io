I'm writing this in 2019, although it will be filed in 2018 for my life's chronological order, but this is more of a reflection on what was different here as well as what I think was amazing here.

Now apart from the incredible luck of having 1) a good idea delivered right to my team and 2) the really sicko teams were out of topic there's some really good thing we can take from here.

Firstly the fact that our idea was presentable. I think the problem with my 2019 idea was that unless we had a flawless implementation, we couldnt demonstrate the idea properly. Our 2018 demonstration sucked ass but the idea was very obvious, the presentation itself was also very easy to understand what was going on at the end.

Secondly, the project was an incredibly small scope. using a deterministic solution is really the key here. Having something that wasn't up to chance means debugging is really do-able.

Finally I think complexity of UI made this project take just a little bit too much time. UI has to look good, but it has also have to be simple.
